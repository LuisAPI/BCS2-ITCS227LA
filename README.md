## About this repository

All activities done for laboratory sessions for the subject “Application Development and Emerging Technologies” (codes: ITCS227 and ITCS227LA) are uploaded here for archival purposes.

Additionally, this repo can serve as a guide for future generations of students at De La Salle University–Dasmariñas, as to what to expect and what kinds of homework our instructor, Mr. Deri Estrobo, will hand out to us.

This repository is maintained by Luis Anton P. Imperial, second-year BS Computer Science student at DLSU-D.

## What scripts are included in this repository?

**Grade computation system.** Immediately in the first week of classes (January 29 – February 2), we were asked to compute the total grade a DLSU-D student would receive based on the division of tasks as follows: 3 quizzes, 3 projects, class-participatory assessments and recitations, and the periodical exam.

**Payroll computation system.** With a given daily rate of ₱347.00 and income tax of 10%, this script accepts only one input: the hours an employee has worked.
