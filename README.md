## About this repository

All activities done for laboratory sessions for the subject “Application Development and Emerging Technologies” (codes: ITCS227 and ITCS227LA) are uploaded here for archival purposes.

Additionally, this repo can serve as a guide for future generations of students at De La Salle University–Dasmariñas, as to what to expect and what kinds of homework our instructor, Mr. Deri Estrobo, will hand out to us.

This repository is maintained by Luis Anton P. Imperial, second-year BS Computer Science student at DLSU-D.

## What scripts are included in this repository?

### Midterm period scripts

**Grade computation system.** Immediately in the first week of classes (January 29 – February 2), we were asked to compute the total grade a DLSU-D student would receive based on the division of tasks as follows: 3 quizzes, 3 projects, class-participatory assessments and recitations, and the periodical exam.

**Payroll computation system.** With a given daily rate of ₱347.00 and income tax of 10%, this script accepts only one input: the hours an employee has worked.

**Business bill computation system.** Present a customer with the total bill to be paid for a restaurant service after additional fees, such as a baked-in service charge and sales tax, are added to the input.

**Budget computation system.** Enter a salary into the script and it will provide a recommended budget for needs, wants and emergency savings.

**Manipulation and parsing of lists.** The third week of class (February 12) had us create a list of five numerical inputs, with the script presenting as output the sum, average and the smallest number in the list.

**Random element selection.** This one was to accept five inputs, whether string or number, and simply remove one from the list. The remaining would then be shown to the user.

**Manipulation and parsing of dictionaries.** We were given a dictionary of five sets of keys and values, with all values being numerical. The script would take them all in and, respectively, add or multiply them with each other using a for-loop. The end results were the sum and the product of the values given.

**Palindrome checker.** View whether or not a given input is a palindrome, which is a type of string that when reversed, retains the same order of characters.

**Fibonacci sequence.** Our midterm laboratory exam, held two weeks before Holy Week, computes the Fibonacci sequence reaching a certain count. Baked in the script is an algorithm to produce such sequence, as a culmination of the previous lessons throughout the past month and a half.

### Final period scripts

**Cloud storage handling.** The first task assigned to us, after the Holy Week break, was to import the Drive module in Google Colab’s package. This would necessitate the use of Colab’s provided IDE, wherein we would import a given list of grades, and present statistics on it such as the lowest and the average among these.

**Text file analysis.** We then proceeded the following week to read a given set of song lyrics and display its contents, an analysis of it, and metadata we had to research. This ensured that we knew how to manipulate external data sets distributed through Google’s off-shore cloud storage service, Drive.
