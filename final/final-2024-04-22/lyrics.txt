In the season of blue that seemed to go on forever
Nothing obstructed the view of the four lined eyes
The asphalt ground was echoing the chorus of cicadas
It prevented me from hearing the silence of you

Those days faded away
Even after I got to know the smell of you, different from mine

In the depths of eternity that left behind
Our blue still lives
Our blue is still clear
No prayer or word could ever reach you
No matter how close they could get to you

In such a color as if it were a silent love
Or as if it were a summer rolling down a cheek
I've got a curse word for you stuck in the back of my throat
It is the unvoiced voice that says
"We'll see each other again, won't we?"

Like star grains in an infinitely expanding galaxy
Spilling through the gaps between my fingers
